# 🚗 License Plate Detection from Live Video Feed
This project focuses on detecting license plates from live video feeds using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques. It includes vehicle tracking, license plate detection, and text extraction, all integrated into a robust pipeline.

### ✨ Features
- **🚘 Live Vehicle Tracking:** Accurate tracking of vehicles using the SORT algorithm.
- **🪪 License Plate Detection: **Utilized a YOLOv8-based model for precise license plate identification.
- **🔍 Text Extraction: **Implemented edge detection, thresholding, and OCR techniques for accurate text extraction from license plates.
- **🤖 Machine Learning:** Developed a custom-trained model using diverse web-sourced datasets.
### 🛠️ Technologies Used
**💻 Programming Language:** Python
**📦 Libraries and Tools:**
- OpenCV for image processing and video handling.
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 for vehicle and license plate detection.
- EasyOCR for text extraction from images.
- SORT Algorithm for vehicle tracking.
### ⚙️ Code Workflow
- **📄 Load Models: **Initialize YOLO models for vehicle and license plate detection.
- **📹 Video Input: **Load video feed from a live stream or file.
- **🚗 Vehicle Detection:** Detect and track vehicles in each frame.
- **🪪 License Plate Detection:** Identify license plates within detected vehicles.
